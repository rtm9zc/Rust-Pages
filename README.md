Introduction to Rust: From HelloWorld to MapReduce in Four Steps
=========

![RustLogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtm9zc/Rust-Pages/gh-pages/rust-logo.png)
Rust, in the words of the developers, is a ["systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes, and eliminates data races."](http://www.rust-lang.org/) 
These characteristics make it well suited for developing large, concurrent, performance-critical systems that are so prevelant in today's computing world.

We'll start with basic Rust syntax, before moving through pointers, data structures, concurrency, and some parts of the standard library. The end goal is to be able to produce a [MapReduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) program in Rust.

This tutorial is designed to expand upon and build off of the tutorial
offered at <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org">rust-lang.org</a>, going
in greater depth on certain topics and focusing the introduction around
a concrete goal.  It does not attempt to cover all of the Rust language,
but does aim to give programmers a clear idea of whether or not Rust is
the right language for their projects and to provide a good start to
becoming a Rust programmer.

If you haven't already installed Rust, that would be a good first step.
There are excellent guides over at <a

the official site</a> which should help you with this.</p>
